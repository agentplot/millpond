# The site

millpond's site at https://agentplot.github.io/millpond, an
[Astro](https://astro.build) site with
[Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build), published by
`.github/workflows/pages.yml` on every push to `main` that touches it.

```sh
devenv shell -- site-build     # moon run site:build: dist/, every internal link checked
devenv shell -- prose          # Vale over the pages and the README
cd site && bun run dev         # http://localhost:4321/millpond/
devenv shell -- site-shots <dir>   # screenshots: every page, both widths, both themes, and diagram frames
```

The family's look is `@agentplot/site-theme`: its `starlight.css` carries
the type, the ink and paper of both themes and the accent, `--ap-accent`,
which its family bar sets from the family list (millpond's blue). Its
header puts the family bar above Starlight's, its footer adds the family's,
and How it fits shows its family diagram with millpond highlighted.

## Where things live

| path | what |
|---|---|
| `src/content/docs/` | one page per file: start, how it works, how it fits, design, roadmap |
| `src/diagrams/` | the diagrams, drawn at build time: `kit.ts` the builder, one file per diagram |
| `src/components/Diagram.astro` | inlines a diagram's wide and narrow layouts and shows the one its column fits |
| `src/components/Hero.astro` | the start page's hero, with the animated diagram |
| `src/styles/brand.css` | the diagrams' palette, `--dg-*`, drawn from the theme's `--ap-*` tokens |
| `scripts/shots.mjs` | the screenshots, with Playwright and the Chromium devenv provides |

## The diagrams

Each diagram is an SVG with CSS keyframes only, so it animates with no
script and follows the theme toggle through the `--dg-*` variables. Each
makes one claim, and its animation shows the mechanism moving. A reader
who asks for less motion sees one still frame chosen to hold the whole
claim. Every diagram is drawn twice, a wide layout for a column of 600
pixels or more and a narrow one for a phone.

`bun run readme-diagram` writes the hero as a standalone SVG with its own
palette, `docs/diagrams/millpond.svg`, for the README.
